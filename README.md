# Web50 2020 Project 0 - Homepage

My website is a protfolio website showcasing my journey into computer science via blogs, courses I have takes and the projects I have completed along the way.
I have added animations to the website.

## index.html

This is the first page of my website. I have used a bootstrap carousel to showcase 2 web application projects that I have deployed.

## blogs.html

The content on this page includes blogs about my journey into computer science. There are same-page links, a sticky collapsible navbar (bootstrap 4 component) and a jumbotron header.

## courses.html

A table with the courses I have completed or are completing now. Bootstrap 4 styling used and own colours chosen.

## projects.html

The content on this page is about the projects I have completed for my courses and links to those projects. I used my own styling to add a zoom element to each column when hovered.

## interests.html

The content on this page is about my likes and interests. Images with a text overlay is used where the text shows when you hover over image.

## styles.scss

Used scss so that I could create colour variables along with nesting and inheritance.
Used bootstrap 4 styling throughout each webpage and some of bootstrap 4 jquery for the navbar so it is collapsible.

## javascript.js

2 functions: one to offset page when loading same-page ('#') links in the blogs page and one to show overlay when image is clicked on interests.html for mobile screens and screens that don't support hover.

## react.js

Just started to look into React and used it to automatically update the year in the footer.
