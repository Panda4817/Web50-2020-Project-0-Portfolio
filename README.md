# Portfolio

A website showcasing my journey into software development via blogs, courses I have taken and the projects I have completed along the way.
I used Mustache.js templates to render HTML. I used SCSS and Sass so that I could create colour variables along with nesting and inheritance. I used Bootstrap 4 styling and JQuery throughout each webpage to ensure the website is user-friendly and mobile responsive. All pages have a jumbotron header, a sticky collapsible navbar and a footer with links to other profile pages.

## index.html

This is the first page of my website. I have used an Owl carousel and Animate.css to showcase a variety of projects.

## projects.html

The content on this page is about the projects I have completed, with links to them. The projects are displayed in a masonry grid and can be filtered through tags and a token field.

## courses.html

A Bootstrap table with the courses I have completed and the training I have received. The table changes to Bootstrap cards on smaller screen sizes.

## blogs.html

The content on this page includes short blogs about my journey into software development. Each blog zooms in, a feature from Animate.css, as the user scrolls down.

## interests.html

This pages shows my other likes and interests. Images with a text overlay is used where the text shows when you hover over image (or tap on touch screens).
