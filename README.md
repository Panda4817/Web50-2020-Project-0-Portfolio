# Portfolio

A simple website showcasing my skills, experience and personal projects.
I used Mustache.js templates to render HTML. I used SCSS and Sass so that I could create colour variables along with nesting and inheritance. I used Bootstrap 4 styling and JQuery throughout each webpage to ensure the website is user-friendly and mobile responsive. All pages have a jumbotron header, a sticky collapsible navbar and a footer with links to other profile pages.

## index.html

This is the first page of my website that lists out my main skills.

## projects.html

The content on this page is about the projects I have completed, with links to them. The projects are displayed in a masonry grid and can be filtered through tags and a token field.

## experience.html

The content on this page includes relevant commercial experience in software development.
